Mawaqit Prayer Notifications (Brave/Chromium Extension)

Features
- Fetches prayer times from a Mawaqit mosque page
- Schedules Brave notifications at prayer times (optionally minutes before)
- Refreshes times daily at a configurable local hour
- Configurable mosque URL and which prayers to notify

How to load in Brave
1. Open brave://extensions
2. Enable Developer mode (top-right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this folder: C:\\Projects\\mawaqit_extension

Configure
- Open the extension options (on the extension card → Details → Extension options)
- Set the mosque URL (default is Mosquée de la Robertsau - Strasbourg)

Notes
- Notifications fire when the browser is open. If Brave is closed at a scheduled time, the notification is missed. On next startup, the extension refreshes and schedules the remaining ones.
